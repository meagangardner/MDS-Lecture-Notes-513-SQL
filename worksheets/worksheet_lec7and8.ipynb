    "Welcome to Worksheet 1! This worksheet was designed to allow you to practice what was covered in the assigned readings and lectures from lecture 7 and 8. The lab problems will be more challenging than those in the worksheet, and the worksheet questions will help prepare you for them. Time will be provided to work on the worksheets in small groups during the lecture; however, it is not expected that you will complete the worksheet at this time. You are expected to spend some independent time working on the worksheet after the lecture.\n",

    "Points for this worksheet constitute 1%(0.5% + 0.5%) of your final grade (as we won't be having a clicker in the last two lectures). This worksheet will be marked on a 0/1/2 point scale for effort and completion — not necessarily for correct answers.\n",

    "- (2 points) The student made a serious effort at answering each question, showing work where work is called for. It is not necessary that the answer be correct.\n",
    "- (1 point) The student made a serious effort on at least half of the questions.\n",
