    "- Thanks Stephanie, Meagan, Prajeet and Daniel for helping out with lectures.\n",
    "- I have updated the Lecture 3 themes notes. You will find clicker questions and a couple of additional examples included.\n",
    "- The practice quiz has been released (on Monday morning). Solutions will not be available until Sunday at midnight. After that, they will be accessible within PrairieLearn.\n",
    "    - Refer to the policies and workspace.\n",

    "- Make sure to allow time for the workspace to load. Familiarize yourself with the pgAdmin workspace, including where to find tables and how to run queries. Not knowing how to use pgAdmin is not a valid excuse for being unable to answer quiz questions.\n",
    "- If you encounter any issues during the quiz, you MUST notify the proctor immediately. During an investigation, we will consider the following to understand what happened:\n",
    "    - Proctor notes to verify if the issue was reported.\n",
    "    - PrairieLearn logs to check for any server-side issues.\n",
    "    - pgAdmin logs to identify potential pgAdmin-related issues.\n",
    "- I have rescheduled the canceled office hour to Thursday from 1–2 PM in my office, ICCS 185. Feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss the quiz, quiz preparation, or any lecture topics you are struggling to understand.\n",
