    "\n",
    "## Announcements\n",
    "- Quiz 1 has been fully graded, and overall, you’ve done a great job.\n",
    "- There won’t be practice questions for Lectures 7 and 8 (apologies - got too busy).\n",
    "- Quiz 1 results will be available on PrairieLearn under the Gradebook on Wednesday, so you can decide if you’d like to book review section at CBTF.\n",
    "- We will have a worksheet this week, with time at the end of class to work on it. One TA (Daniel/Jeremy) and I will be there to assist you.\n",
    "- You all know about the policies regarding the quiz and autograding. Here are the Quiz 1 policies for your reference:\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Exam Instructions:\n",
    "You must click Save on every question before the timer runs out or your work will not be saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "All quiz questions in 513 are autograded. If your code has a syntax error, you'll receive a zero. Only copy the code needed to produce the required output.\n",
    "For coding questions, partial credit is not awarded. But you will receive 25% of the points only if your code runs and is VERY close to the expected output, meaning it covers almost all requirements but misses just one item; otherwise, no points will be awarded.\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Good news is that above category of students recieve 75% instead of 25% for the coding questions. We will keep this policy for quiz 2 as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quiz 2 Preparation\n",
    "- For the second quiz, there will be overlaps with topics covered in Quiz 1. Be prepared.\n",
    "- Time will be a challenge, so make sure to practice extensively and have resources ready - an effective cheat sheet is a good strategy.\n",
    "- We won’t provide a workspace for MongoDB. Since you won’t be able to test MQL, I won’t ask you to write MQL queries. However, you should be able to understand them.\n",
    "- Since we are now in a bit more complex SQL world, we’ve updated the pgAdmin workspace to include auto-completion. Hopefully, you’ll find it useful.\n",
    "- A practice quiz for Quiz 2 has also been released.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Today's Theme\n",

    "- We learned about the use of aliases and how to use them. (AS)\n",
    "- We learned about the use of IN, ANY, ALL, EXISTS, NOT EXISTS\n",
    "- We learned about subqueries and correlated subqueries.\n",
    "- views vs materialized views vs tables vs temp tables vs CTEs\n",

    "## Story Time (Justin Beiber problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "<img src=\"img/justin.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out [this article](https://www.wired.com/2015/11/how-instagram-solved-its-justin-bieber-problem/) to know why I am here!!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the right tool for the job. So far, we’ve used RDBMS appropriately by normalizing it, using indexes wherever needed & denormalizing it for analytical and dashboard purposes. Postgres or any other database ( like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server) can support very large operations. Instagram, IMDB, Skype, and others use Postgres for business-critical services. However, SQL is not suited to all analyses. Here is what happened with Instagram - how Justin Beiber's popularity could destroy the entire infrastructure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even around 2013, Instagram already had a pretty big infrastructure, and they used to use Postgres as their database. Everything was going well until Justin Beiber got into Instagram. He was one of the first high-profile people to get on Instagram. When he would post something, people would comment and like him so much. But people around the globe are doing it simultaneously that it is hitting servers so fast that people can't see their likes or comments, or it took a long time for that to get updated as a result of [locking tables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/explicit-locking.html). After so much debugging of this issue, Instagram decided to move to a hybrid system with Amazon Cassandra and Postgres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The takeaway message from this story is that even though they had a big infrastructure on Postgres, no other techniques really worked out to solve this problem. And they want to rely on a hybrid solution ( Postgres and Cassandra) to this problem. Most data systems are hybrid in the era we are in; you will experience this when you start working in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of RDBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses a (semi) standard language (SQL) across all platforms.\n",
    "- Uses ACID principles\n",
    "    - Atomic Transactions\n",
    "    - Consistent data representation\n",
    "    - Independent Transactions\n",
    "    - Durable Data\n",
    "- Highly optimized query planner (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages of RDBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write times and table locks reduce efficiency\n",
    "    - Particularly when the upsert level is high (UPDATE & INSERT)\n",
    "- Some data has complex models\n",
    "- Some data may be “sparse” in a normalized format\n",
    "- Documents & keys may not be suited to an RDBMS\n",
    "- Scaling difficulties\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is NoSQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "<img src=\"img/NoSQL.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "[Here](http://www.strozzi.it/cgi-bin/CSA/tw7/I/en_US/nosql/Home%20Page) check out the real NoSQL from 1998.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (Not (Only) SQL) has been there for quite a while now. It was first introduced in 1998 by [Carlo Strozzi’s](http://www.strozzi.it/users/carlo/vitae.html) to call his lightweight, relational database that did not follow the standard SQL interface, and hence NoSQL. Later, in 2000, this became popular as the hashtag #NoSQL to discuss the advancement in the non-relational database world. It's a trendy buzzword these days.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Goals of NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce the dependence on fixed data schema.\n",
    "- Reduce the dependence on a single point of truth.\n",
    "- Scaling!\n",
    "\n",
    "### NoSQL Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "I came up with [the BASE] acronym with my students in their office earlier that year. I agree it is contrived a bit, but so is \"ACID\" -- much more than people realize, so we figured it was good enough. ***- Eric Brewer***\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- (semi) Schema-free\n",
    "  - With no referential integrity and internal consistency, we can easily split data across servers\n",
    "- Accepting Basic Availability:\n",
    "  - You usually see all the tweets when you sort by “Latest”, but sometimes a refresh shows some messages you missed.\n",
    "  - You are usually chatting in real-time, but sometimes messages pile up.\n",
    "- NoSQL is BASE\n",
    "  - Basically Available\n",
    "  - Soft State\n",
    "  - Eventual Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different types of NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key–value store\n",
    "\n",
    "In these kinds of databases, data is stored as key-value pairs. You can think of it as a giant dictionary object. In these cases, the database will contain a simple, unique string as the key, and that key will point to a large data value. The data value can be stored as an integer, a string, or a complex structure. This database is based on the Amazon Dynamo [paper](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., Amazon DynamoDB, Redis, Memcached\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Document store\n",
    "\n",
    "A type of key-value DB with an internal (searchable) structure. A “document” contains all relevant data and has a unique key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg: ElasticSearch, MongoDB, AWS DocumentDB\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Column based\n",
    "\n",
    "Column-based databases are built based on google's big table [paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf). Our normal files and relational databases store data in the disk in a row-based fashion, but here data is stored in a column-based fashion. Efficiency comes in filtering when a few columns are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., Bigtable, Cassandra, Amazon Redshift.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph based\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are defined with properties focused on relationships between objects. More to follow...\n",
    "\n",
